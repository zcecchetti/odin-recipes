    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is my family's own style of Focaccia bread. This version is a lot
        shorter than traditional Focaccia, but it is just as delicious! This 
        goes great as an appetizer at a party or as sandwhich bread. </p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1 pkg dry yead</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>6 c. flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Mix 1 pkg dry yeast in 2 c. warm water.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 t. salt, 1 Tbl. Olive Oil.</li>
        <li>Mix 4 c. flour.</li>
        <li>Put 2 c. flour on chopping block and add dough.  Knead dough 
            until it is workable (will stop sticking to hands).  Place in
             greased bowl (use a bit of Olive Oil), cover, let rise until
              doubled (about 1-hour). <i>*Sometimes I add dried rosemary*</i>
        </li>
        <li>Push dough down and pat out on chopping block.  Separate into 
            two dough balls, and flatten on greased and salted cookie 
            sheets.  Cover and let rise again (approx 1-hr).  Then, stretch
             dough and make "knuckles" in dough.  Brush top with olive oil
              and salt. <i>*Sometimes I add a couple cloves of fresh minced 
              garlic and brush on top with the oil*</i>
        </li>
        <li>Bake at 450-475 for about 20 minutes or until golden brown 
            (I usually set the timer for 15 mins and starting checking).  
            Remove from oven, brush again with olive oil and salt.  Let 
            cool on cooling rack and then cute into squares.
        </li>
