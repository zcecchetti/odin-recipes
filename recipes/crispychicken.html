    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe for chicken thighs that was gievn to me 
        by my mom. Chicken thighs stay moist, even when overcooked, as 
        compared to chicken breasts, so for this reason I prefer to 
        use thighs. When done right, the skin is so crispy and delicious 
        that myself or my partner just can't get enough! </p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>6 - 8 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 - 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tsp oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat oven to 450F and set a baking sheet in your workspace.</li>
        <li>Combine all seasonings in a small bowl and stir until everything
            is evenly mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Take chicken thighs out of the fridge and place them each on the
            baking sheet. With a papertowel (or a few), dry each thigh above 
            and below the skin. This is going to help the skin achieve its 
            crispiness!
        </li>
        <li>Oil each thigh well with the olive oil. The thighs should be covered
            all around. Then rub the seasoning mixture all over the chicken thighs,
            including above and below the skin.
        </li>
        <li>Once the oven is preheated, place the baking sheet in the oven and 
            cook for 50 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>When done, the chicken should be well cooked through and the skin
            should be crispy. Let cool for 5 - 10 minutes and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
