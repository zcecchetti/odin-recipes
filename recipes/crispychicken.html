    <h2>Descrition:</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe for chicken thighs that was gievn to me 
        by my mom. Chicken thighs stay moist, even when overcooked, as 
        compared to chicken breasts, so for this reason I prefer to  
        use thighs. When done right, the skin is so crispy and delicious 
        that myself or my partner just can't get enough!
