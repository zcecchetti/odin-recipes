    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe for chicken thighs that was gievn to me 
        by my mom. Chicken thighs stay moist, even when overcooked, as 
        compared to chicken breasts, so for this reason I prefer to 
        use thighs. When done right, the skin is so crispy and delicious 
        that myself or my partner just can't get enough! </p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>6 - 8 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 - 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tsp oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
